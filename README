* An internet connection for iDroid install/upgrade features
* iPhone 3G, 2G or iPod Touch 1G
* Being jailbroken with blackra1n, redsn0w, PwnageTool, or sn0wbreeze
* Bravery - my code is hardly the best :P

Known issues: 

* On iOS 4.1 or above, Zephyr2 firmware fails to extract, meaning the device won't have working touch, at least while jailbroken with redsn0w.

Compilation Requirements:

Exact requirements unknown, but it builds with Xcode 4.2.1 on Lion + the iOS 3.1.2 SDK added on.
A recent version of dpkg to build the .deb file

To Compile:

Copy libcurl headers folder from your device into the PartialZip directory.  Use XCode to build libbz2 and libpartialzip.  Make sure the .a files   are placed in build/Release-iphoneos/

Then, run:

  $ make clean && make
  
Finally, you have two options:

To install to device, enter the IP address of the device in the Makefile, and run:

  $ make install
  
followed by a reboot

  
OR, copy the application into the "deb" folder, set ownership and file permissions and use the command to make a .deb:
 
  $ sudo dpkg-deb -Zgzip -b deb bootlace.deb
